- **Variant**: AttnOnly suggests that the model uses attention mechanisms, which are typically good for focusing on relevant parts of the context. However, in this case, the attention mechanism did not effectively highlight the correct information.
- **Question**: The question is clear and specific, asking about the principality founded by William the Conqueror.
- **Context**: The context provides detailed information about the Normans and their influence but does not explicitly state the principality founded by William the Conqueror, which might have contributed to the model's failure to generate a correct answer.
- **Reference Answers**: The absence of reference answers makes it difficult to compare the generated answer against a gold standard, but the context alone is sufficient to determine the generated answer's inadequacy.

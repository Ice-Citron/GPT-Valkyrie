- **Variant**: FFNonly indicates that the model might be using only Feed-Forward Networks. This could explain the lack of coherence and context understanding in the generated text.
- **Prompt**: The prompt is clear and specific, focusing on the sensory experience of the aroma of freshly baked bread. It provides a good starting point for a descriptive and engaging piece of writing.

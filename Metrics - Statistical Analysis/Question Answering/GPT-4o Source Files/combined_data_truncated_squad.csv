The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).",[],"when did Nors encampments ivolve into destructive incursions?In the course of the 10th century, the initially destructive incursions of Norse war",2.0,2,1,2,2,3,"The generated answer is not satisfactory.

The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.

- **Norm Type**: RMSN (Root Mean Square Normalization) is a technique used in neural networks, but the ""noNorm"" variant indicates that this normalization was not applied. This might affect the model's performance.
- **Variant**: The ""noNorm"" variant suggests that the model does not use normalization techniques, which could impact its ability to generate accurate and relevant answers.
- **Question**: The question is clear and asks for the name derived from the English words Normans/Normanz.
- **Context**: The context provides detailed etymological information about the name ""Normans,"" tracing its origins through various languages and historical forms.
- **Reference Answers**: There are no reference answers provided, which makes it difficult to compare the generated answer against a standard. However, the context itself is sufficient to determine the correct answer.

The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis).","['911', '911', '911']", 911,5.0,5,5,5,5,5,"The generated answer is accurate, complete, relevant, fluent, and concise. It perfectly matches the reference answers and the context provided.","- **Model Name**: The model name ""shng2025/GPT-Valkyrie_RMSN-124m__noNorm__SQuAD"" indicates that this is a specific variant of the GPT-Valkyrie model, which has been trained on the SQuAD dataset. The model's performance in this instance is excellent, as it provided a correct and concise answer.
- **Norm Type**: The ""RMSN"" norm type suggests a specific normalization technique used during training or inference. The absence of normalization (""noNorm"") in this variant does not seem to have negatively impacted the model's ability to generate a correct answer.
- **Variant**: The ""noNorm"" variant indicates that no normalization was applied. Despite this, the model performed well, suggesting that normalization may not be critical for this type of question.
- **Question**: The question ""When was the Duchy of Normandy founded?"" is straightforward and fact-based, which the model handled effectively.
- **Context**: The context provided detailed historical information about the founding of the Duchy of Normandy, including the exact year, which the model accurately extracted.
- **Reference Answers**: The reference answers were all ""911,"" which aligns with the generated answer, confirming its correctness.

Overall, the model demonstrated excellent performance in this evaluation.

        "\n",
        "Key steps:\n",
        "a. Check if synchronization is needed:\n",
        "   - The model is in training mode (`self.training`)\n",
        "   - Distributed training is initialized (`torch.distributed.is_initialized()`)\n",
        "\n",

        "d. Determine if synchronization is actually needed (more than one GPU)\n",
        "\n",
        "e. If synchronization is needed:\n",
        "   - Implement logic to gather statistics from all GPUs\n",
        "   - Compute global statistics\n",
        "   - Apply these global statistics in the normalization process\n",
        "\n",
        "f. If synchronization is not needed:\n",
        "   - Proceed with the standard PowerNorm logic\n",

        "2. Comparison: F.batch_norm vs sync_batch_norm.apply()\n",
        "\n",
        "a. F.batch_norm:\n",
        "   - Standard batch normalization function\n",
        "   - Operates independently on each GPU in a multi-GPU setup\n",
        "   - Computes mean and variance using only the local batch on each GPU\n",
        "   - Faster for single-GPU or small-scale multi-GPU setups\n",
        "   - May lead to inconsistent statistics across GPUs in large-scale distributed training\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "output = F.batch_norm(input, running_mean, running_var, weight, bias,\n",
        "                      training, momentum, eps)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "b. sync_batch_norm.apply():\n",
        "   - Synchronized version of batch normalization\n",
        "   - Coordinates computation across all GPUs in a distributed setup\n",
        "   - Computes global mean and variance by aggregating statistics from all GPUs\n",
        "   - Ensures consistent normalization across the entire model, regardless of data distribution across GPUs\n",
        "   - More computationally expensive due to inter-GPU communication\n",
        "   - Crucial for maintaining model consistency in large-scale distributed training\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "1. Consistency: sync_batch_norm ensures consistent statistics across all GPUs, while F.batch_norm does not.\n",
        "2. Communication: sync_batch_norm involves inter-GPU communication, F.batch_norm does not.\n",
        "3. Computational cost: sync_batch_norm is more expensive due to synchronization overhead.\n",
        "4. Scale of distribution: sync_batch_norm is more suitable for large-scale distributed training.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use which:\n",
        "- Use F.batch_norm for single-GPU training or when batch statistics on each GPU are representative of the whole dataset.\n",
        "- Use sync_batch_norm.apply() for large-scale distributed training where maintaining consistent statistics across GPUs is crucial for model stability and performance."
